      <h3>Trillium Bluetooth Event Tracker - Project Synopsis</h3>

      <p>The Trillium Bluetooth Tracker project aims to provide a reliable means to ensure participant safety during long races through the use of bluetooth device tracking. Major features supporting this primary goal include participant check in/out logs and location estimation, automatically generated alerts, support for staff chat, and comprehensive participant map and status overview. With the secondary goal of providing participant statistics, event promotion, additional desired features include support for participant account creation and connection to social media platforms.
      Similar existing applications such as MapMyRide provide mapping and tracking but require internet or data connection, which in a variety of race terrain is not always existent or reliable. The Bluetooth Tracker application will solve this complication by communicating with small, inexpensive bluetooth devices given to each race participant. Once a beacon receives a signal from a participant it will record when they enter and leave checkpoints and mobile SAG (Support, Assistance, Gear) vehicles. Staff in the SAG vehicles and at other checkpoints will have iPads or other similar devices that will receive bluetooth signals, correlate them with the iPadâ€™s known GPS coordinates, and store this data to be updated on all staff devices. Staff devices will be updated, provided they have a signal. If a device does not have a signal it will asynchronously update as soon as a signal is found, allowing for as optimal communication as possible.</p>

      Hello, I am a fifth year Software Engineering major with a concentration in Usability and
      a Mandarin Chinese minor. I have done co-ops with SAIC (Science Applications International Coporation),
      the National Geospatial Agency, General Dynamics, Oracle, and Microsoft. Through co-ops and classes
      I have gained valuable experience working on diverse teams using a variety of development tools,
      languages, and processes. Senior project provides a great opportunity to apply knowledge gained throughout
      time in college as well as to learn even more in the process. I am expecially looking forward to the
      mobile and bluetooth development and project management learning experiences this project will provide.
      The Trillium Event Tracker is an exciting project and I'm looking forward to working on this project with
      the rest of this motivated team.
      </p>
