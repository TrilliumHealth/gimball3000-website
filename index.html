      <h3>Trillium Bluetooth Event Tracker - Project Synopsis</h3>

      <p>The Trillium Bluetooth Tracker project aims to provide a reliable means to ensure participant safety during long races through the use of bluetooth device tracking. Major features supporting this primary goal include participant check in/out logs and location estimation, automatically generated alerts, support for staff chat, and comprehensive participant map and status overview. With the secondary goal of providing participant statistics, event promotion, additional desired features include support for participant account creation and connection to social media platforms.
      Similar existing applications such as MapMyRide provide mapping and tracking but require internet or data connection, which in a variety of race terrain is not always existent or reliable. The Bluetooth Tracker application will solve this complication by communicating with small, inexpensive bluetooth devices given to each race participant. Once a beacon receives a signal from a participant it will record when they enter and leave checkpoints and mobile SAG (Support, Assistance, Gear) vehicles. Staff in the SAG vehicles and at other checkpoints will have iPads or other similar devices that will receive bluetooth signals, correlate them with the iPadâ€™s known GPS coordinates, and store this data to be updated on all staff devices. Staff devices will be updated, provided they have a signal. If a device does not have a signal it will asynchronously update as soon as a signal is found, allowing for as optimal communication as possible.</p>

      to do a solid amount of work considering this is the first week back from a long break. Much of this work
      was done locally or on branches, though, and so does not reflect in the metrics.

      <h4>Winter Break</h4>
      <u><b>Recent Project Work</b></u> <br />
      Although members of the team planned to work over winter break, minimal work was done. 
      The break was a necessray decompression period for the team as students, however, and provided 
      the time necessary for us to relax before the final push in the last semester.
      Completed work still included the following:
      <ul>
         <li>Continued work on bluetooth thread optimization
         <li>Revised route upload (save to database)

      <h4>Week 10 (10/26/15)</h4>
      <u><b>Recent Project Work</b></u> <br />
      This week our team has re-evaluated and gotten external advice on our schedule, as far as our spiral iteration and phase lengths. With this re-evaluation came the decision to switch to shorter spiral iterations and phases, which allow for a slightly more aglie-esqe development cycle that incorporates more risk management and prototyping more frequently.
      <br />
      Other work our team has been doing includes:
      <ul>
         <li>Completed Jenkins setup
         <li>Planning for new upcoming iteration 3
         <li>Completed Architecture Doc
      </ul>
      <u><b>Metrics Updates</b></u> <br />
      Note that we have switched to new repos since we're moving into iteration 3 and formal development instead of prototyping. This means metrics have been reset (minus those regarding risks).

      Hello, I am a fifth year Software Engineering major with a concentration in Usability and
      a Mandarin Chinese minor. I have done co-ops with SAIC (Science Applications International Coporation),
      the National Geospatial Agency, General Dynamics, Oracle, and Microsoft. Through co-ops and classes
      I have gained valuable experience working on diverse teams using a variety of development tools,
      languages, and processes. Senior project provides a great opportunity to apply knowledge gained throughout
      time in college as well as to learn even more in the process. I am expecially looking forward to the
      mobile and bluetooth development and project management learning experiences this project will provide.
      The Trillium Event Tracker is an exciting project and I'm looking forward to working on this project with
      the rest of this motivated team.

      Hey there, I'm a fifth year SE major with a concentration in security and criminal justice. I've worked
      for Constant Contact, M&T Bank, and here at RIT in the grad program. I work most comfortably in the back-
      end of a system, and when possible, focus primarily on system functionality and data management. This
      makes me well-suited to tackle some of the functional requirments for this project, and lead the effort
      to create fast and effective middle-ware that the rest of the system can depend on.

            My name is Anshul Kapoor and I'm a senior studying Software Engineering and Economics. I have an interest in
            web development but I also like to keep my self updated with events in the financial world. I'm excited to
            work on this project and get experience with beacon technologies and iOS.
