Major features supporting this primary goal include participant check in/out logs and location estimation, automatically generated alerts, support for staff chat, and comprehensive participant map and status overview. With the secondary goal of providing participant statistics, event promotion, additional desired features include support for participant account creation and connection to social media platforms.\r\nSimilar existing applications such as MapMyRide provide mapping and tracking but require internet or data connection, which in a variety of race terrain is not always existent or reliable. The Bluetooth Tracker application will solve this complication by communicating with small, inexpensive bluetooth devices given to each race participant. Once a beacon receives a signal from a participant it will record when they enter and leave checkpoints and mobile SAG (Support, Assistance, Gear) vehicles. Staff in the SAG vehicles and at other checkpoints will have iPads or other similar devices that will receive bluetooth signals, correlate them with the iPad’s known GPS coordinates, and store this data to be updated on all staff devices. Staff devices will be updated, provided they have a signal. If a device does not have a signal it will asynchronously update as soon as a signal is found, allowing for as optimal communication as possible.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
